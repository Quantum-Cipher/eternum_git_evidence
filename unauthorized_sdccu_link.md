# Unauthorized SDCCU Payment Trigger — Investigative Log

## Overview

- Appointment scheduled online, no payment link received
- Friend’s SDCCU card used only to fund MetaMask via Firefox
- Card was never saved or used for appointment
- No confirmation text, yet the payment processed

## Concerns

- SDCCU infrastructure breach or internal flagging?
- MetaMask silently retained payment-capable session?
- Firefox-level session bleed?
- Web-to-wallet script injection or monitoring?

## Additional Context

- Same SDCCU bank used by Subject Delta (my father)
- Doctor appointment data potentially linked to healthcare/pharma abuse investigation
- Possibility: payment system routed through embedded surveillance infrastructure
