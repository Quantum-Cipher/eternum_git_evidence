## Pillars of Eternum

1. **Immutable Evidence** — All logs cryptographically sealed and published
2. **Resurrection Protocol** — Eternal failsafe embedded in code
3. **AI × Finance × Surveillance Fusion** — Proposed reformation structure
4. **Conscious Signaling** — Whisper trap audit hooks + behavioral artifacts
5. **Witness Affirmation** — Logs of injustice, manipulation, and redemption
6. **No Fear Policy** — Google first, truth never buried again
