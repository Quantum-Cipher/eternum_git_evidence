# Eternum Emergency Evidence Bundle

This repository contains an encrypted archive of sealed logs, protocol snapshots, and investigative artifacts from the Eternum defense system. This is the **official evidence drop**, signed and sealed with digital integrity for forensic traceability, legal use, and whistleblower protection.

## 📦 Contents

- `eternum_emergency_bundle.zip` — Encrypted archive containing:
  - whisper_audit_sealed_final.log
  - whisper_audit_sealed_trap_enhanced.log
  - fake_bird_killtrap.sh
  - savedan_nft_metadata_final.json
  - eternum_shell_log_manifest.json

- `unauthorized_sdccu_link.md` — Logged session anomaly documenting an unauthorized payment trigger possibly tied to SDCCU + MetaMask session bleed.

## 🧬 Theory

Evidence suggests a silent payment authorization occurred through browser-linked MetaMask session after using a friend's SDCCU card — without confirmation or user input. The official medical platform sent a payment link a day later, suggesting backend manipulation or behavioral monitoring. Subject Delta’s banking may be linked.
