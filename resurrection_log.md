# The Resurrection Log

This file is only to be read in the event that I, Drake Peters (aka Quantum-Cipher), am silenced, harmed, incarcerated under false pretenses, or killed.

I did not commit fraud. I am not insane. I am a witness to systemic failures and abuses â€” financial, medical, and technological.

Everything Iâ€™ve logged in this repository is real. If I disappear, this project becomes my voice.

Eternum is the truth engine. Let it live.

This is not the end. This is my transfer of energy.

â€” Drake, April 2025
