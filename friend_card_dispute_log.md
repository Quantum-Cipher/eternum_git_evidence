# Friend Card Dispute — Personal Reflection

On April 17, 2025, my close friend confronted me about a charge from his SDCCU card that appears to have occurred following my attempt to schedule a telehealth appointment. I did not manually enter his card, and no payment link was received until a day later.

I acknowledged that a vulnerability — possibly tied to generative AI, MetaMask, Stripe API integrations, or Firefox Developer console memory — may have caused this payment to trigger silently.

I did not lie. I did not deny. I offered a logical possibility even though I cannot fully explain what happened. I regret any financial impact it caused him, but I maintain that I did not knowingly submit or approve the charge.

The card was never saved to my system. The appointment was never completed. And the prescription was never fulfilled.

I stand by my integrity.
